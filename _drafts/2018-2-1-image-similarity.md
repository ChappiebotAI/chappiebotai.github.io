In [OtoNhanh.vn](https://www.otonhanh.vn/), many users desire to compare the images between two models. To do that, we 
classify the images of a model into several classes. Then we can pick randomly the images in the same class of two models. 
However, inspite of belonging to the same class, there are visual differences between the images because of the position, 
the poses, the scale, etc. of the objects.
